## This repository

- [openapi.json](openapi.json): Local OpenAPI definition of the API, cloned [from the official one](https://www.wikidata.org/w/rest.php/wikibase/v0/openapi.json) and adapted to work with OpenAPI generator (all structures that are referenced through `~1` or `/allOf/` are extracted inside `#/components/schemas/` and referenced directly)
- [src/generated](src/generated): Typescript API code, autogenerated with OpenAPI-generator from the above specification through `npm run generate`
  - At the time of writing this, OpenAPI generator introduces a bug in the generated code solvable with `npm run fix`
- [src/test](src/test) includes some manually written tests for the code, runnable through `npm test`
- [tsup.config.ts](tsup.config.ts) includes the configuration to transpile the autogenerated Typescript code into the packaged Javascript files in the dist folder with `npm run build`
- The autogenerated and output code can be cleaned up with `npm run clean`
